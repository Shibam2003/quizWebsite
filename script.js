    All months have 28 days because even though some months have more than 28 days, no month has less than 28 days. Therefore, every month has at least 28 days.`,

    Certainly, let's break it down step by step: 1. The farmer starts with 17 goats 2. The phrase "all of them but 8 die" means that all the goats except for 8 have died. So, subtracting those goats from the total, you have 17 - 8 = 9 goats that have died. 3. Therefore, the number of goats that are still alive is the initial number of goats minus the number that have died, which is 17 - 9 = 8 goats. So, there are 8 goats that are still alive.`,
